# React Native Goal Logger

A React Native App for logging and managing goals.

## Setup

1. Install NodeJS
2. Install `expo-cli`: https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/
3. Install Android Studio and setup the emulator: https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
4. Ensure _Google Play Services_ is also installed in Android Studio DK Manager.
5. Create an emulator, preferably with _Google Play Services_.
6. Install node modules:

   ```bash
   cd ./rn-first-app
   npm install
   ```

## Development

1. Run the npm scripts:

   ```bash
   npm start # Runs expo cli on http://localhost:19002/
   ```

2. Start a virtual Android device.

3. Trigger Expo CLI to launch the app on the virtual Android device by pressing key `a` in the terminal. You can also, instead, access `http://localhost:19002/` from your browser and click on the _Run on Android device/emulator_ button.
